## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

A `GCM_SENDER_ID` environment variable must be passed to the server, for example:
```bash
GCM_SENDER_ID=829104499569 npm start
```

Sender IDs can be obtained [from the Google Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notificatons-on-the-open-web#make-a-project-on-the-google-developer-console).
